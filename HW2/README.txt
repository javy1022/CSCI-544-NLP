The executable is named CSCI544_HW2.py along with the needed data files in the "src" repository. The program will output the 4 required output files in the same repository. 
Pre-generated (required output files) are also included for reference in the folder "output_files". 

P.S.
CSCI544_HW2.py is developed and should be runnable without any problem in Pycharm Community 2022.3.2
